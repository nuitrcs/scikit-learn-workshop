# Scikit-Learn Workshop Series
Scikit-Learn is one of the major libraries for machine learning in Python. This series comprises four workshops designed to give you a map of Scikit-Learnâ€™s different functionalities and place you on firm ground to start using it for your machine-learning projects. 

### Getting Started

-   Download the materials to your machine by clicking on the green "Code" button on the top right and selecting "Download ZIP".
-   Unzip the downloaded folder, and double-click on the .ipynb file to open it up in your favorite code editor.

## Part 1 - The Data Science Pipeline
This workshop introduces the fundamentals of machine learning (ML): How does ML differ from statistics? Which types of problems are best suited for ML? We will explore different real-world problems and learn to distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning. You will become familiar with the main stages of the data science pipeline: data wrangling, cleaning and pre-processing, modeling, optimization and model validation, and post-processing and visualization.
