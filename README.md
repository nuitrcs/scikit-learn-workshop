# Scikit-Learn Workshop Series
Scikit-Learn is one of the major libraries for machine learning in Python. This series comprises four workshops designed to give you a map of Scikit-Learnâ€™s different functionalities and place you on firm ground to start using it for your machine-learning projects. 

### Getting Started

-   Download the materials to your machine by clicking on the green "Code" button on the top right and selecting "Download ZIP".
-   Unzip the downloaded folder, and double-click on the .ipynb file to open it up in your favorite code editor.
-  You can also open the notebook directly in Google Colab by clicking on the notebook linked in the description for each part.

## Part 1 - The Data Science Pipeline
This workshop introduces the fundamentals of machine learning (ML): How does ML differ from statistics? Which types of problems are best suited for ML? We will explore different real-world problems and learn to distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning. You will become familiar with the main stages of the data science pipeline: data wrangling, cleaning and pre-processing, modeling, optimization and model validation, and post-processing and visualization.

## Part 2 - Supervised Learning - Regression
Regression analysis is a powerful tool for uncovering the associations between features of your data (known as independent variables) and dependent variables (usually denoted by Y). In this workshop, you will learn to identify ML tasks suited for regression analysis, appropriately process independent variables, train and evaluate models, and generate predictions. We will also discuss some common pitfalls and assumptions of the chosen modeling techniques.

## Part 3 - Supervised Learning - Regression and Regularization
In this session, we will continue modeling with linear regression. We will train, and optimize our model. We will also learn to evaluate models and generate predictions. If time permits, we will then go through the concept of regularization and hyperparameter tuning for ML models.

## Part 4 - Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
In this session, we will learn the basics of clustering. Time permitting, we will explore a bit of dimensionality reduction.
